          <h1 id="first-card">Essential Characteristics:</h1>
          <h2>On-demand self-service,</h2>
          <p>
            A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such
            as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without
            requiring human interaction with each service provider.
          </p>
          <h2>Broad network access,</h2>
          <p>
            Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through
            standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick
            client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and
            workstations).
          </p>
          <h2>Resource pooling,</h2>
          <p>
            The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple
            consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and
            virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to
            consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that
            the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact
            location of the provided resources but may be able to specify
            location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or
            datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing,
            memory, and network bandwidth.
          </p>
          <h2>Rapid elasticity,</h2>
          <p>
            Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some
            cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward
            commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities
            available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be
            appropriated in any quantity at any time.
          </p>
          <h2>Measured service,</h2>
          <p>
            Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by
            leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction
            appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing,
            bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
            monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both
            the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
          </p>

          <h1 id="second-card">Service Models:</h1>
          <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS),</h2>
          <p>
            The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s
            applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are
            accessible from various client devices through either a thin client
            interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a
            program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the
            underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
            operating systems, storage, or even individual application
            capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user- specific
            application configuration settings.
          </p>
          <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS),</h2>
          <p>
            The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
            infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created
            using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools
            supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control
            the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
            operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed
            applications and possibly configuration settings for the
            application-hosting environment
          </p>
          <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),</h2>
          <p>
            The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing,
            storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where
            the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can
            include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not
            manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has
            control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications;
            and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g.,
            host firewalls).

          <h1 id="third-card">Deployment Models:</h1>
          <h2>Private cloud,</h2>
          <p>
            The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a
            single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business
            units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization,
            a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or
            off premises.
          </p>
          <h2>Community cloud,</h2>
          <p>
            The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a
            specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared
            concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and
            compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated
            by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party,
            or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
          </p>
          <h2>Public cloud,</h2>
          <p>
            The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general
            public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business,
            academic, or government organization, or some combination of them.
            It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
          </p>
          <h2>Hybrid cloud,</h2>
          <p>
            The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct
            cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain
            unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or
            proprietary technology that enables data and application portability
            (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).
